# SIMPLE LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
<h2>A system that helps manage the operations of a library.</h2>
<h3>
   It allows librarians or administrators to perform tasks such as adding and removing books, managing book borrowing and returning, and keeping track of library members.

The system uses Python, a programming language, to build the software application. Python provides the necessary tools to create a user-friendly interface and handle various operations within the library management system.

MySQL Workbench, on the other hand, is a graphical tool used to manage databases. In this case, it is used to store and retrieve data related to books, library members, and transactions.

The library management system allows librarians to add new books to the library database, including information such as the book title, author, and ISBN. They can also remove books from the system when needed.

For library members, the system enables them to search for available books and check their availability. They can borrow books by providing their membership details, and the system updates the database to reflect the borrowed status of the book. When a member returns a book, the system records the return and updates the availability status accordingly.

Overall, the library management system helps automate various tasks in a library, making it easier to manage book inventory, track borrowing and returning activities, and provide efficient services to library members.
